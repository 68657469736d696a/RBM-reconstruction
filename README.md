_Not in use anymore. Replaced by my own RBM implementation https://github.com/sdverkoelen/RBM_

An extention to the work of Zach Mayer (https://github.com/zachmayer/rbm)

The aim of this code is the reconstruction of information through a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Basically sending a respresentation in the hidden layer back to the visible layer.
The code contains functions for a single and stacked RBM's among a simple example

Reconstructions are probabilistic. Using a set.seed() is recommended for reproducable results.
